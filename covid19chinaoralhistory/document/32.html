                <h3 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">A restaurateur's perspective on COVID19</h3>
                <div id="intro" style="padding: 20px">
                I have been engaged in the catering industry for 20 years. I have been fond of cooking since I was a child, because of my love. When I was very young, my father was a passenger carrier and my mother had a management position in a coal mine factory. So I was alone at home for a long time. My neighbor, the income is very good, can eat meat every day, and then there is a restaurant next to my home, every day is also a lot of customers. In such an environment, the air is full of the fragrance of food every day, but there is no one in my home, so I began to learn to cook by myself since my childhood, in order to make myself eat whatever I want in the future, I will have a restaurant of my own.
                </div>
                <div id="contentArea">
                    <h5 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">An understanding of the epidemic</h5>
                    <p>Before this outbreak, we actually had a similar experience, and we were lucky to survive it. I remember SARS in 2003, when I was a newcomer to the industry. It's true that we've had a lot of impact, and the number of guests in the restaurant in the single digits a day. In such a bad environment at that time, I chose to listen to the request of the government and protect my employees and customers. To be precise is to follow the government's instructions and not violate them. Fortunately, in the end, following the government's request, the epidemic turned around, and our business began to pick up.</p>
                    <p>This time, the situation is quite severe, so our family is very serious. Through daily news channels and official online news, we know that the virus spreads from person to person and spreads very fast. The consequences of the disease are fatal to the lungs. So we responded to the call of the government, do not go out, do not party, do a good job of protection. For example, wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds at home, disinfect clothes with alcohol, throw away disposable masks, open Windows for ventilation and so on. We think it is important to have a deep understanding of the disease and not to pass it on to others or to ourselves.</p>
                    <h5 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">The adjustment of the restaurant's operation mode</h5>
                    <p>Having said that about my own family, it was almost my job. The impact has been huge for us, we've been closed down with pneumonia for more than 40 days. It is easier for us to close the door, but if we want to open the door, it is too difficult. We will be very worried about the business of the whole restaurant when it opens. We expect to lose money for as long as 3 to 6 months. Then we ourselves only in this year to control the expenses and costs, do not lay off staff, do not reduce wages on the basis of this year's difficulties.</p>
                    <p>So I made some adjustments to our business model. In the past, our business model was mainly offline in-store food, without considering online sales, such as take-out or secondary processed food. After experiencing the pneumonia this time, we decided to open up the online food access after returning to work, so as to achieve both online and offline business. During the epidemic, we paid attention to this problem, which had never been considered before. If we could get online sales, our situation would not be as difficult as it is now.</p>
                    <h5 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">Government support through the epidemic</h5>
                    <p>In fact, the most noticeable thing is the policies provided by the government. As a restaurant owner, I strongly support the relevant provisions formulated by the government. In order to restore the prosperity of the catering industry, the government has come up with many measures and introduced many preferential policies for us, such as tax reduction and exemption, social security, rent and so on. So on the whole, the state is doing pretty well. At the same time, I also hope that the country can put forward more preferential measures.</p>

                    <h5 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">Gradually return to normal business</h5>
                    <p>I have changed my mind to face the loss well. Our decision is to close the shops with bad business for the time being. And in the unnecessary expenditure link, carries on a strict control; In addition, as for the staff, we take turns to work; Water and electricity will also be controlled. Cut unnecessary spending across the board to get through this crisis. The main difficulty we face is the cash flow instant noodles, as long as the cash flow does not break, then the restaurant can run smoothly.</p>
                    <p>The current situation is not getting better, we are continuing to suspend business, I support the suspension of business, now the state has allowed our catering industry to resume work, hall food opened. But it's very difficult to reopen a store after you've closed it. It's a very long and complicated process. We want to protect the restaurant brand we've been operating for 20 years, and we want to protect the interests of every employee. We can only resume work in batches, so when the situation improves, we will open one store at a time, rather than all at once. If the business is not good, we will not open for business. At the same time, because of the impact of the epidemic, the panic has not dissipated. People are now more resistant to the virus than they are to partying and playing. Only when the panic of most citizens is over can we truly open our doors and serve everyone better. Because our brand enjoys a good reputation in Chongqing, I believe I can win the trust of customers in hygiene.</p>
                    <p>Having said all these good things, let's move on to the biggest obstacle. For example, the government requires our enterprises to continuously pay the employees during the lockout, which makes the situation worse for our operators. Since our restaurant does not have any income, in fact, the staff should be considerate to our operators, and the government should not come out to force us to provide wages. But for the sake of social harmony, we will also comply with the government's requirements.</p>
